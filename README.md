Hello and welcome to my webpage. I am a Ph.D. student at [TAMU](https://www.tamu.edu/), working under the supervision of [Dr. Srikanth Saripalli](https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/profiles/saripalli.html) of the [Unmanned Systems Lab](https://unmanned.tamu.edu/).  My research interests are Robot State Estimation, Perception and Sensor Calibration. 

I have a Master's degree in Control Systems Engineering from [École centrale de Nantes](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/), France. I did my [MS thesis](https://github.com/SubMishMar/SubMishMar.github.io/blob/master/thesis/Master_Internship_Report_MISHRA_Subodh%5BRevised%5D.pdf) at [CNRS-LAAS](https://www.laas.fr/public/en) under the guidance of [Dr. Antonio Franchi](https://homepages.laas.fr/afranchi/robotics/?q=node/1) on the topic of Aerial+Ground Co-Manipulation Systems.
