 <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li> <b>Augmented SLAM with Online Multi-Sensor Calibration:</b> This prject deals with usage of cheap and expendable robots for exploration and information gathering in an adversarial environment and how the probable death of the autonomous agent can help to formulate better planning algorithms for those robots hat follow the first one. We formulate this problem as a <i>Markov Decision Process</i>. This projects examines a  model of a task where robot mortality is presupposed, and examines how destruction of a robot serves as an information source. The basic setting is that a robot operator has a swarm of cheap disposable robots; these are deployed in sequence, each performing a hazardous navigation mission, either completing their mission or failing to return. Situational awareness is improved in in either case: the operator uses robot failure, including destruction, serves as an information source</li>
